            "excerpt": "In many cases, it is difficult to explain how machine learning models predict. Transparency becomes a big issue when it comes to applying models in several real-life areas. Here, we discuss how we can explain a model’s predictions and how people’s trust in the model depends on its explainability. We also try to understand where certain caution is required. AI-based products and services are increasingly prevalent for decision making in a wide range of domains. Machine learning models predict decisions based on patterns from data. When the complexity   and amount of data grows, it becomes harder to explain ...",
