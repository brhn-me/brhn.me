\[This is a lost entry from my word press blog site from 2019\]

Before I write what’s on my mind, lets read the story I just copied from internet.

_There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. “Such bad luck,” they said sympathetically._

_“Maybe,” the farmer replied._

_The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How wonderful,” the neighbors exclaimed._

_“Maybe,” replied the old man._

_The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy for what they called his “misfortune.”_

_“Maybe,” answered the farmer._

_The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son’s leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out._

_“Maybe,” said the farmer._

Well, the point I want to make here is very simple. Everything is temporary. Everyone and everything, good or bad person or situation is impermanent. Everything regardless how you feel about it will perish sooner or later in nature. When you accept this transient nature of everything, you achieve calmness and inner peace.

There was a king who had everything, mammoth land mass to rule, lots of power and wealth but he lacked one thing, its “inner peace”. He was always stressed. He was desperate to find calmness but he could not. He asked around his advisors to figure out a way and declared exchange of his entire kingdom, power and wealth for a solution. But no one could come up with any good proposals. One day a saint visited him and provided him with a ring that has something written on it. He asked the king to read whats written on his ring every time he felt stressed. This time, his formula magically worked. The king realized how momentary his problems were! How he was stressed about things beyond his control and about the things that are going to pass away like the clouds floating on sky.

So what was written on the ring?

**This too shall pass!**
