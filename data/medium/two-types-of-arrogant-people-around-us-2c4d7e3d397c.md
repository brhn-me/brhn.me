In our daily life we often encounter these two sort of people. According to my observations they both are arrogant.

1. **The Over Educated Arrogant**  
This guy believes he is superior than anyone else because he has collected some more degrees than others. Even if something does not belong to his field of expertise, he thinks he is entitled to know or do better than anyone else.  
\- “ I have got 3.99 cgpa in my class. I know better than you how to score a goal in a football match. Shut up!”
2. **The Under Educated Arrogant**  
This guy is the opposite for the first one. Just because a person has given him some advice, he doesn’t want to listen or learn. He thinks that a educated moron is always trying to show off his knowledge by giving him advice.  
\- “Ehh! I should not believe in pani pora (An elixir distributed by religious person)! What does he think of himself? Just because he got more degrees how can he know that pani pora does not work?”

> _Arrogance is the need to feel superior and entitled than others around you._

> _Confidence is acknowledging that you are good enough without the need to compare yourself with anyone else._
