Trekking in Kashmir Great Lakes

I had been fortunate enough to go on a few trekking on the Himalayas in the last couple of years. Those trekking trips have left me with some ingenious lessons that can not only be useful for trekking but also in all aspects of life.

### **You are very small, smaller than what you think**

The first thing I realized after climbing mountains for a day is that I am small. Not only small but very very tiny. Smaller than even what I had thought of myself. Honestly, I had no idea of what is coming. On Annapurna base camp trek we passed right beside a large 3 story school building at the start of the trek in the morning. That day we kept climbing and I looked back at the school building every time we took a break. That building never disappeared from our sight for almost the entire day but kept getting smaller. In the afternoon, after a full day of the hard climb when I looked back and that building was looking just as large as an small ant.

Now I imagine that climbing for another five days and when the building has gone out of sight! And you are comparing a small mountain on a pale blue dot. Can you just give a thought on how insignificant you are on the grand scale of the universe?

> The first impression that mountains give you is that oh sh\*t! I am too small! I don’t matter!! My expectations don’t matter! I am just too insignificant!

### **It is all about enjoying the journey, nothing much about reaching the destination**

This is some gem of a lesson. Let’s face it. In trekking, it is mostly about enjoying the path, not the destination. Unlike going on a tourist destination where you have all the fun at the destination, in trekking you have to find the satisfaction mostly on the journey. Our real life is a lot like this. Accept it or not. It doesn’t simply worth doing anything if you do not enjoy the road towards it. If you don’t enjoy your work then it does not worth pursuing that track even if you make tons of money on it. Eventually, your life will become a lie, filled with unhappiness and regrets.

I see many people doing this wrongly in their life. We often call it the rat race. Doing things even when they don’t like it just for the sake of future success. This insidious pursuing success and living in the future will eventually hunt all of them down for their entire life in terms of stress first and followed by regret. On the contrary, enjoying the journey to do something means you are living more on the present moment will eventually lead to happiness. **If you are not enjoying what you are doing, it simply does not worth your time!** As Paulo Coelho once said,

> We are in such a hurry to grow up, and then we long for our lost childhood. We make ourselves ill earning money, and then spend all our money on getting well again. We think so much about the future that we neglect the present, and thus experience neither the present nor the future. We live as if we were never going to die, and die as if we had never lived…

### **It is okay to let other people go ahead of you**

One of the key lessons for trekking is to go at your pace and not trying to catch others. As a first time trekker, it was really hard for me to climb up all those stairs. Ascending through all these treacherous rocks and gravel wasn’t easy for a guy who is always used to walk on flats. Then there were many guys who just ran passed me. They were just so fast and unstoppable, that I named few a flying horse or flying fish. But then I realized it is not their first time. They have many experiences and their body is adopted to this type of climbing already. Some have natural advantages, instead of sitting in front of a computer like me all day, some people have to do cycling the entire day for their profession. All of these random events have given some of these people an upper hand, **something that I don’t control neither something that I need to care about. All I need is to focus on myself**.

> In real life there will be always some people who will go ahead of you that you can’t even catch. Some people will always cross you from behind. But guess what’s the best! You don’t have to chase them. All you need is to keep progressing and keep progressing at your own pace and keep enjoying the journey. That’s all what it matters

You have to accept that everyone is unique on this planet. Everyone has advantages on a few things and disadvantages for many others. That’s just okay. We just need to stop measuring ourselves and stop beating our own selves for not being up to someone else’s standard. Just cherish your own forte and uniqueness.

### If you only focus on the next small step you are going to make it very far.

Climbing the mountain as a first-timer was quite difficult. There were often times when I felt like I wanted to give up. I wanted to drop dead and felt like an asshole to be there in the first place. I felt like my road is never going to end or I am never going to make it to the top. But I somehow managed to do it. All I had to do is to focus on taking the one single step ahead. By taking one small single step at a time, we have managed to reach the apex which once seemed daunting. I could not have believed on the second day what I had achieved on the last day.

> It doesn’t matter how far it is, or how hard it is. Don’t bother how many detours you have to take. Only focus on the very moment and take one single step ahead, always heading for the same destination. Trust me you are going to make it, slowly but surely.

### Sometimes to go up, first, you have to go down

On our way to Annapurna, we climbed to Poon Hill first. It’s a peak at 10,000 feet above sea level. I thought in excitement, Ah, we have made it to ten thousand feet already, only another 3500 feet and we will be at our destination. But I was wrong!

So wrong that we kept descending that entire day on our way to ascending Annapurna Base Camp. We keep going down and down through the other side of the mountain. We went down to a far lower altitude than from where we started. From that low point, there was a sharp ascend for another hour followed by another couple of hours of going down again. And this type of going up and down kept repeating for the next few days. We often climbed to a certain point and then got down to a lower altitude position than where we started initially.

> In life, there will be always ups and downs, If it was all flat, then it would have been too boring!

### It is possible to live a good life on a few basic needs

When we went to Kashmir Great Lakes trek a high altitude uninhabited haven on earth, we were carrying all of our stuff by ourselves and in horses back. We had very limited resources and amenities as it was very hard and expensive to carry anything extravagant on the trek. We were forced to be stingy on our resource consumption. After having a small breakfast and trekking half day our lunch was limited to having a small roti (bread) and some vegetables. After working this hard all day and eating so small we didn’t get sick rather we got fitter, all of us! Meaning we waste a significant amount of food in our regular life, being a couch potato and overeating entire life. At that trek, we were also forced to drink water from fountains, dig holes on soil and poop on inside a toilet tent. What made me realize how fortunate we are to live in a modern world instead of some two thousand years ago. We have an abundance of luxuries yet we complain about almost everything.

I feel pity for that friend who is frustrated because his other friend has bought an iPhone and he still couldn’t or that guy who is ripping off his hair seeing his facebook friend traveling on a luxury cruise.

> It is not that we have enough, we have more than enough. We complain not because we don’t have enough, but we subconsciously compare ourselves with others or seek unnecessary validations

### Best view comes after the hardest climb

Trekking for all those days was hard, on higher altitudes, it was getting even harder due to lack of oxygen. But every time on the pinnacle of our journey we found the most breathtaking views. Be it on Annapurna or Kashmir, Meghalaya or Keokradong in Bandarban.

In our life we have to take this lesson seriously, to be successful in something in your life you have to endure all the pain that the leads to. If you are unable to go through the hardship, you don’t deserve the success. Want to score a good grade? you have to work your ass off for studying. Want to have a great body? You have to work through the pain of going to the gym regularly. Only you go through these hardships you’ll be able to produce the results.

Accept these or not. Some people might say you people are doing these hard trekking for showing off. Well, actually trekking is never for show off. Going on a luxury resort for a night at a cost of 15 days traveling, and shooting photos for the sake of posting on Instagram is showing off. Trekking can significantly deepen your view about life and widen your myopic perspective.

### In a nutshell…

\[Special thanks to Mashruf Zaman for providing this excellent summary of this article in response\]

* **You are insignificant and it’s okay**. If you can think this way, it only makes you more humble in my opinion.
* **Don’t envy others.** There’s always someone better than you. Live your life and let live others.
* **Enjoy the ride.** Don’t chase too hard.
* **Take small steps.** Work and solve by differentiation ;) _Pomodoro?_
* **There are ups and downs in life.**
* **We don’t need much to be happy.** We can survive on basic needs and be happy about it. _Zen mode?_
* **Hard work always pays off.**
