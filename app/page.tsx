        Hi ðŸ‘‹ <br /><br />
        I am <strong>Burhan</strong>. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence specialization at the University of Oulu.
        Previously, I have worked at a Nordic AI startup. During my undergrad, our team built the first-ever Bengali search engine, 
        securing significant funding. My current research interests include federated learning and knowledge distillation with multimodal data.
